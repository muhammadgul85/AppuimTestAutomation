Abstraction
Encapsulation = Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps it's state private inside a class and other objects don't have directs access to state. Instead they can
                only call a list of public function and that is a called Method.
                so the object manages it's own state via methods and other class can touch it unless explicitly allowed.
